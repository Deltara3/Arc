# Arc
An operating system written in *mostly* [SPWN](https://github.com/Spu7Nix/SPWN-language)

## About
Currently it doesn't do anything.

## Requirements
I suck at Makefile, so make sure you have the following.

- GRUB
- GCC
- NASM
- XORRISO
- LD

## Questions and Answers
> Why was Arc chosen? It doesn't fit the SPWN naming scheme.
